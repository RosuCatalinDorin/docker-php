[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kariae/docker-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kariae/docker-php) ![Contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)

## Installation
1. Create a `.env` from `.env.dist` file, and customize it according to your preferences.
2. Update your hosts file according to the [NGINX server configuration](https://github.com/kariae/docker-php/blob/master/nginx/conf.d/lekode.conf#L2)
```bash
# UNIX
sudo echo "0.0.0.0 lekode.dev" >> /etc/hosts
# Windows (edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts)
```
3. Build containers
`docker-compose build`

## Usage
After building the containers, just run them and you’re ready to go
`docker-compose up -d`

## Utils
Here is a list of things that can help you

### xDebug
- [x] TODO: How to configure xDebug with a code editor. (an [article](https://lekode.com/2017/12/18/debugging-your-php-application-inside-a-docker-environment-using-xdebug/) that explain how to use it with your IDE.)

### Customize containers for different environment
- [x] TODO: Add other useful containers (Redis, phpMyAdmin …)
- [ ] TODO: Customize NGINX for other frameworks than Symfony (Add .conf file per framework)

### Execute commands inside containers
You may need to execute commands inside php-fpm container to clear Symfony cache, install fixtures or whatever, to do this, check your container name from running containers list, connect to your container, and execute your command
```bash
docker ps
docker exec -ti lekode.lab.php sh
php bin/console ...
```
